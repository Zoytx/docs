Enterprise customers can bring their own TTS service or work with Luly’s engineering team to configure higher quality voice clones.

Enterprise customers can also request foreign languages like German, Spanish, Italian, and Portoguese, and Luly’s engineering team will set up different transcription and TTS to accomodate the request.

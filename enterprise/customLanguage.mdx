Enterprise customers can bring their own TTS service or work with malakai’s engineering team to configure higher quality voice clones.

Enterprise customers can also request foreign languages like German, Spanish, Italian, and Portoguese, and malakai’s engineering team will set up different transcription and TTS to accomodate the request.

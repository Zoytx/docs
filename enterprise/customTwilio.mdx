## Overview

Enterprise customers can connect their own Twilio account to Luly. Easily bring over your existing phone numbers, integrations, and more.

Pre-requisites:
- Your own Twilio account

## Step 1: Creating an Encrypted Key with your Twilio Credentials

1. Go to your [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/login?g=%2Fconsole%3F&t=2b1c98334b25c1a785ef15b6556396290e3c704a9b57fc40687cbccd79c46a8c) and get your Account SID and Auth Token.
2. create an  ```encrypted_key``` by [sending an API request](https://docs.luly.ai/api-reference/twilioAccounts/create) to Luly.

This is the only time that your encrypted_key will be returned to you. Make sure to store it securely, and new keys will need to be generated if lost.

## Step 2: Using the Encrypted Key in Outbound Calls

Include ```encrypted_key``` in the headers (in addition to the ```Authorization``` header) of your API requests, and we’ll use that account’s credentials to make the call.

For example:

```javascript Example
{
    "Authorization": "abc",
    "encrypted_key": "bcd"
}
```

Note:

- You can set your ```from``` number in the API request - this will need to be a number owned by that Twilio account (and not one purchased through Luly).
- By default, we’ll send calls from a randomly selected number in the specified Twilio account if a ```from``` is not specified.

## Step 3: Uploading Inbound numbers

1. Go to your [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/login?g=%2Fconsole%3F&t=2b1c98334b25c1a785ef15b6556396290e3c704a9b57fc40687cbccd79c46a8c) and get your your Twilio phone number(s).
2. Upload your numbers [through the API](https://docs.luly.ai/api-reference/twilioAccounts/upload) 

We’ll validate that these numbers are owned by that account and add them to your Luly account.

## Step 4: Configuring Inbound Numbers/Webhooks

Note: When updating inbound numbers, the headers need to the include the ```encrypted_key``` in addition to the ```Authorization``` header. Doing so makes sure the updates are applied to the correct Twilio account

Once you update an inbound number through the [Dev Portal](https://portal.luly.ai/) or [API](https://docs.luly.ai/api-reference/inbound/update), that number will be automatically configured to run on Luly’s infrastructure. No additional steps are required!

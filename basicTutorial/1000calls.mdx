## Step 1: Setup Your Authorization

To initiate a batch call, you must first authenticate your request. Ensure you have your API key from signing up on the [developer portal](https://portal.luly.ai/).

## Step 2: Prepare the Call Data

Craft a base prompt that will be common across all calls in the batch. Use placeholders ```{{curly_braces}}``` for dynamic content.

Example:

```
"You are calling {{business}} to renew their subscription to {{service}} before it expires on {{date}}.";
```

## Step 3: Define the Call Data

Specify the list of calls in the ```call_data``` array. Each call must have a ```phone_number```and can include other properties corresponding to placeholders in your base prompt.

Example

```JSON
[
  {
    phone_number: "1234567890",
    business: "ABC co.",
    service: "Netflix",
    date: "September 4th",
  },
  {
    phone_number: "32176540987",
    business: "XYZ inc.",
    service: "Window Cleaning",
    date: "December 20th",
  },
];
```

Step 4: Additional Configuration

- ```label``` : Assign a label to your batch for easy tracking.
- ```campaign_id``` : Organize related batches under a campaign.
- ```test_mode``` : Set to true for testing with the first call only.
- ```batch_id``` : Manually set or auto-generated for tracking.
- ```voice_id``` : Select a voice for the batch.
- ```reduce_latency``` : Reduce latency for faster processing.
- ```Language``` : Select a language for the batch.
- ```request_data``` : Assign a label to your batch for easy tracking.
- Voice and Language Settings: Select ```voice_id```,```reduce_latency```, and ```Language```

## Step 5: Send the API Request

Use the provided JavaScript or Python code snippet to make the API request.

## Step 6: Handle the Response

After sending the batch request, you’ll receive a response with a ```message``` and the ```batch_id```. Monitor the progress of your calls and any responses via your specified webhook.

Here’s what an example response might look like:
```JSON
{
  "message": "success",
  "batch_id": "3p$7rQ3p9sT5bzmF-gen-batch"
}
```

## Step 7: Monitoring and Analytics

Track the performance and outcomes of your batch calls through the provided ```batch_id``` and campaign analytics. Adjust future batches based on the insights gained.

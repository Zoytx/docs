### Headers

<ParamField header="authorization" type="string" required={true}>
    Your API key for authentication.
</ParamField>

### Path Parameters

<ParamField path="call_id" type="string" required={true}>
    The unique identifier for the call to be analyzed.
</ParamField>



### Request Body

<ParamField body="goal" type="string" required={true}>
    This is the overall purpose of the call. Provides context for the analysis to guide how the questions/transcripts are interpreted.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="questions" type="string[][]" required={true}>
    An array of questions to be analyzed for the call.

    Each question should be an array with two elements: the question text and the expected answer type (e.g., “string”, “boolean”).

    Fairly flexible in terms of the expected answer type, and unanswerable questions will default to ```null```.

    Examples:
    ```json
        "questions": [
            ["Who answered the call?", "human or voicemail"],
            ["Positive feedback about the product: ", "string"],
            ["Negative feedback about the product: ", "string"],
            ["Customer confirmed they were satisfied", "boolean"]
        ]
    ```
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
    Can be ```success``` or ```error```.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
    Confirms the request was successful, or provides an error message if the request failed.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="answers" type="array">
    Contains the analyzed answers for the call in an array.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="credits_used" type="number">
    Token-based price for the analysis request.

    As a rough estimate, the base cost is ```0.003``` credits with an additional ```0.0015``` credits per call in the call.

    Longer call transcripts and higher numbers of questions can increase the cost, however the cost scales very effectively with calls vs. individual calls.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>
```json Response
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Successfully analyzed call",
    "answers": [
        "human",
        "Customer found the product sturdy and reliable",
        "A bit heavy",
        true
    ]
}

```
